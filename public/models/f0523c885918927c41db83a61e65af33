Keeping track of what you have spent on is hard. Predicting what you may spend in the future is even harder. With Plutus, we hope to address this problem.

What it does

Based on your spending and saving habits, Plutus knows what kind of person you are. Plutus lets you search for items you want to buy, and recommends other options that will help you save money in the long run. Visualizations generated by the app will help you easily see the impact of each purchase on your bank account.
Plutus fetches data from your bank account using Capital One's Nessie API and uses a neural network to find out your spending habits.
